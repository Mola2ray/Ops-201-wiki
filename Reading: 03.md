## Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles##


This topic is important because in the IT Industry, helping and effective communication are crucial in team/ group work to come up with solutions to a problem that needs solving. To have a better understanding with who you're taking to, it's crucial to make connection with others to get an understanding of their thought processes and how they view the problem but also guiding them into learning! When we help others learn, we ourselves are learning as well. The power of cohesion and teamwork can lead to a magnificent experience when solving problems.
IT Staff: To include all personnel that work directly with users and clients, and those who work to keep server and network infrastructure fully operational.
The way that I understand it, it's pretty much knowing how to talk to people, understanding the problem at hand, and coming up with a solution together so both ends are satisfied with the solution. On the infracture side, you're working with the technical skills that you have as well as communicating with your team through whatever communication channels available to you.
Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills
Hard Skills: more specific, measurable skills (e.g. configuring and troubleshooting systems)
Soft Skills: ability to communicate effectively with others
Having a mixure of both can help land higher- level positions. Lack of contrast can do the polar opposite.
